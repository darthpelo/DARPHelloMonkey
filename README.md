DARPHelloMonkey
===============

Official Twilio Client for iOS Quickstart Tutorial update to iOS 7 and Xcode 5.

This my version of HelloMonkey application fits the original to iOS 7. I have not added or removed any of the original functions. The problem I wanted to solve is that the sample projects that Twilio makes available, are still to iOS 4.2.

You can find all the information of the original project and the documentation on the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/php/ios-client) website.
