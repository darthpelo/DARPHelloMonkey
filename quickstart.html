<h1 id="twilio-client-ios-quick-start">Twilio Client iOS Quick Start</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>You want your iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch app to make and receive calls?
Want to add voice-chat support to your iOS game for players to mock each
other?  There&rsquo;s an SDK for that!</p>

<p>Twilio Client for iOS is an Objective-C library that enables voice
communications with landlines or other Twilio Client devices, including
web browsers and other mobile devices.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>There are three major pieces in a Twilio Client app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your iOS app that uses the <code>libTwilioClient.a</code> library.</li>
  <li>A server to grant capabilities to your Client app as well as to serve
up <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/">TwiML</a> and/or make Twilio
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/">REST API</a> calls.</li>
  <li>Twilio&rsquo;s cloud services to handle the telephony and process TwiML
and/or REST API calls.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/twilio-ios-diagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="client-side-classes">Client-side Classes</h2>

<p>The primary class for connecting to Twilio services from your app is
<code>TCDevice</code>.  This class coordinates service authorization with Twilio,
listens for incoming connections, and establishes outgoing connections.
An instance of this class is created using a &ldquo;capabilty token&rdquo;,
described in the next section.</p>

<p>Connections to Twilio, either incoming or outgoing, are represented by
instances of the class <code>TCConnection</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, status callbacks are provided to objects that implement the
delegate protocols <code>TCDeviceDelegate</code> and <code>TCConnectionDelegate</code>.</p>

<h2 id="server-side-security-capability-tokens">Server-side Security: Capability Tokens</h2>

<p>The Twilio Client SDK uses a capability token to sign communications
from your iOS app to Twilio. These tokens are created by you on your
server and allow you to specify what capabilities are going to b&rsquo;e
available to your app, such as whether it can receive incoming
connections, make outgoing connections, etc. These tokens always have an
expiration, which means all tokens have a limited lifetime to protect
you from abuse.  It is up to you to determine how often these tokens
must be refreshed.</p>

<p>Twilio capability tokens are based on the JSON Web Token standard.  They
are generated by our helper libraries that come in a variety of
languages.  These libs can be found in the Helper Libs folder of the SDK
or from the
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/">Twilio Helper Libraries</a> page.
Usage is documented more thoroughly in the
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/client/capability-tokens">Capability Tokens</a>
portion of the site.</p>

<p><strong>For the security of your Twilio account, you should not embed a
Capability Token or your Twilio Auth Token as strings in the app you
submit to the App Store.</strong></p>

<h2 id="quickstart-tutorial">Quickstart Tutorial</h2>

<p>In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll demonstrate using the Twilio Client APIs to make
an outgoing call, receive an incoming call, and make calls between two
Twilio Client instances.</p>

<p>This guide assumes you have familiarity with iOS and Objective-C
concepts like View-Controllers, delegates, properties, and Objective-C
object life cycle and memory management.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install Xcode with at least iOS SDK 4.2 or higher.  Xcode may be
obtained from the Mac App Store or by downloading it from
<a href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Get set up as a registered iOS developer with valid Provisioning
Profile(s) for any devices you will be testing with.  For more
information on provisioning devices, please refer to Apple&rsquo;s
documentation
&ldquo;<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/080-Manage_Your_Devices/manage_devices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010215-CH12-SW2">Managing Devices</a>&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>Get a Twilio Account SID and Auth Token to initiate calls from your
iOS device. You will find these in your
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/">Account Dashboard</a>.  If you
don&rsquo;t have an account, you can always sign up for a free
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio">trial account</a>.</li>
  <li>A Twilio Application SID.  A Twilio Application is a convenient way
to store a set of URLs, like the VoiceUrl and SmsUrl on a phone
number, but without locking them to a specific phone number.  Visit
the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/apps">Apps tab</a> to create
an Application.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>The skeleton code for the Quick Start Tutorial can be found in the
<code>QuickStart/</code> folder inside the SDK tarball.  The server-side PHP
and/or XML can be found in the <code>Server/</code> folder inside the project
folder.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>To begin, you&rsquo;ll need to set up a server for sending out capability
tokens.  We&rsquo;ve included a PHP sample file called &ldquo;auth.php&rdquo; that&rsquo;s in
the Server folder next to the Xcode project that can create tokens.
Note that this also makes use of &ldquo;Capability.php&rdquo; that can be found in
the &ldquo;Helper Libs&rdquo; folder at the root of the SDK.</p>

<p><strong>auth.php</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: php">
&lt;?php

include "Services/Twilio/Capability.php";

$accountSid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
$authToken = "secret";

// The app outgoing connections will use:
$appSid = "APabe7650f654fc34655fc81ae71caa3ff[g]";

// The client name for incoming connections:
$clientName = "monkey";

$capability = new Services_Twilio_Capability($accountSid, $authToken);

// This allows incoming connections as $clientName:
$capability-&gt;allowClientIncoming($clientName);

// This allows outgoing connections to $appSid with the "From"
// parameter being the value of $clientName
$capability-&gt;allowClientOutgoing($appSid, array(), $clientName);

// This returns a token to use with Twilio based on
// the account and capabilities defined above
$token = $capability-&gt;generateToken();
echo $token;

?&gt;
</pre>

<p>Making a request to this file on a PHP server will output a string that,
when given to a <code>TCDevice</code>, grants it capabilities such as making outgoing
calls or allowing incoming calls.</p>

<p>Note that the token generated is valid for 1 hour unless otherwise
specified.  To specify a different period of time, pass in the number of
seconds as an integer parameter to <code>generateToken()</code> &ndash; for example, for a
token that expires after 5 minutes, call <code>generateToken(300)</code>.</p>

<p>To fetch the token, put the <code>auth.php</code> file and Twilio Helper Library PHP
files on your server, and then modify the <code>$accountSid</code> and <code>$authToken</code> to
be values from your Twilio account.  To make sure it works, open a web
browser and hit the URL (e.g. http://companyfoo.com/auth.php).  Assuming
there aren&rsquo;t any issues, you should see a long string of text &ndash; this is
a capability token for the user named &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; to receive incoming and
make outgoing calls.</p>

<p>So now let&rsquo;s walk through making an outgoing call to a phone number.
This code can be run either in the iOS Simulator or on your device.</p>

<h2 id="the-xcode-project">The Xcode project</h2>

<p>Next, open the &ldquo;HelloMonkey.xcodeproj&rdquo; Xcode project in <code>HelloMonkey/</code>.
This is a project based on the &ldquo;View-based Application&rdquo; template for
iPhone that has already been configured to work with the Twilio Client
library.  Please see the &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; guide for details on
modifying an Xcode project to use Twilio Client.</p>

<p>The HelloMonkey app is very simple, presenting &ldquo;Dial&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hangup&rdquo;
buttons, and a text field for who the app should call.  The user
interface elements have already been wired up to the
HelloMonkeyViewController class in Interface Builder but don&rsquo;t actually
do anything.</p>

<p>In this step you&rsquo;ll fill in the code to give the app its behavior,
learning how to use the Twilio Client iOS SDK in the process.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-device">Creating a Device</h2>

<p>An instance of <code>TCDevice</code>, an Objective-C class, represents a soft
&ldquo;device&rdquo; that knows how to speak to Twilio services.  You&rsquo;ll use a
<code>TCDevice</code> to initiate outgoing calls and listen for incoming calls.
Let&rsquo;s create an instance and wire it up!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a class called <code>MonkeyPhone</code> that represents a central
coordinator object to talk to the Twilio Client APIs, and this is where
the bulk of the functionality will live.</p>

<p>Add a member variable of type <code>TCDevice</code> to <code>MonkeyPhone.h</code> like so:</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.h</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
#import "TCDevice.h"

@interface MonkeyPhone : NSObject
{
@private
    TCDevice* _device;
}

@end
</pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s initialize it and dispose of it properly in <code>init</code> and <code>dealloc</code>,
respectively.</p>

<p>To initialize a device, you&rsquo;ll change the URL to point to your server&rsquo;s
<code>auth.php</code> file and pass the resulting string to
<code>-initWithCapabilityToken:delegate:</code>.  We&rsquo;ll also dispose of the device in
<code>dealloc</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Make sure you swap in your Capability Token URL for the sample
URL in <code>MonkeyPhone</code>&rsquo;s <code>init</code> method.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong></p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(id)init
{
    if ( self = [super init] )
    {
        NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://companyfoo.com/auth.php"];   
        NSURLResponse *response = nil;   
        NSError *error = nil;   
        NSData data = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url]
                                            returningResponse:&amp;response
                                                        error:&amp;error ];
        if (data)   
        {   
            NSHTTPURLResponse *httpResponse = (NSHTTPURLResponse *)response;   

            if (httpResponse.statusCode == 200)   
            {   
                NSString *capabilityToken = [[[NSString alloc] initWithData:data   
                                                                   encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]    
                                             autorelease];   

                _device = [[TCDevice alloc] initWithCapabilityToken:capabilityToken   
                                                           delegate:nil];
            }
            else
            {
                NSString *errorString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"HTTP status code %d",
                        httpResponse.statusCode];   
                NSLog(@"Error logging in: %@", errorString);   
            }   
        }   
        else   
        {   
            NSLog(@"Error logging in: %@", [error localizedDescription]);   
        }   
    }

    return self;
}

-(void)dealloc  
{
    [_device release];   
    [super dealloc];  
}
</pre>

<p>If you compile and run this code, you should see the following:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/ios-hello-monkey.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got an app that can create outgoing connections and receive
incoming connections.</p>

<p>For the time being we&rsquo;ll focus on making an outgoing connection.  The
connection will call a Twilio sample application that responds with a
friendly greeting.</p>

<h2 id="dialing-out">Dialing Out</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add a method to MonkeyPhone to initiate a connection.  We&rsquo;ll keep
track of the connection we&rsquo;ve created as a member variable of type
<code>TCConnection</code>.  To make a connection, we call the <code>TCDevice</code>&rsquo;s
<code>-connect:(NSDictionary*)params delegate:(id&lt;TCConnectionDelegate&gt;)delegate</code>
method.  Just pass in nil parameters and a nil delegate for the moment;
we&rsquo;ll do more with these arguments later.</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.h</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
#import "TCDevice.h"
#import "TCConnection.h"

@interface MonkeyPhone : NSObject
{
@private
    TCDevice* _device;  
    TCConnection* _connection;
}

-(void)connect;

@end
</pre>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
#import "MonkeyPhone.h"

@implementation MonkeyPhone

// ... unchanged code omitted for brevity

-(void)dealloc  
{
    [_device release];  
    [_connection release];  
    [super dealloc];  
}

-(void)connect
{
    _connection = [_device connect:nil delegate:nil];
    [_connection retain];
}

@end
</pre>

<p>If you take a look at the HelloMonkeyAppDelegate, you&rsquo;ll notice it has a
property <code>MonkeyPhone* phone</code> specified.  When the App Delegate is
launched, it initializes a MonkeyPhone object and sets it as the value
of the phone property.</p>

<p>So now in the <code>-(IBAction)dialButtonPressed:(id)sender</code> method, fetch the
MonkeyPhone from the app delegate, and invoke <code>-(void)connect</code> on it like
so:</p>

<p><strong>HelloMonkeyViewController.m</strong></p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
#import "HelloMonkeyViewController.h"
#import "HelloMonkeyAppDelegate.h"
#import "MonkeyPhone.h"

@implementation HelloMonkeyViewController

// ... unchanged code omitted for brevity

-(IBAction)dialButtonPressed:(id)sender  
{
    HelloMonkeyAppDelegate* appDelegate = (HelloMonkeyAppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
    MonkeyPhone* phone = appDelegate.phone;
    [phone connect];
}

// ... unchanged code omitted for brevity

@end
</pre>

<p>If you now compile the app and run it, you should be able to click the
&ldquo;Dial&rdquo; button and hear the greeting.  Awesome!</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you could also hang up on a connection if you
don&rsquo;t want to hear the whole thing?  Let&rsquo;s go do that now.</p>

<h2 id="hanging-up-from-your-ios-device">Hanging Up From your iOS Device</h2>

<p>Congrats on making your first audio connection from your iOS device to
Twilio!</p>

<p>You should have heard a welcome message but as you probably noticed, you
had no way to close the connection as the Hangup button doesn&rsquo;t do
anything. So, let&rsquo;s add some functionality to do that.</p>

<p>Since MonkeyPhone is the central object coordinating with the Twilio
Client API, let&rsquo;s add a <code>-(void)disconnect</code> method there:</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.h</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
#import "TCDevice.h"
#import "TCConnection.h"

@interface MonkeyPhone : NSObject
{
@private
    TCDevice* _device;  
    TCConnection* _connection;  
}

-(void)connect;  
-(void)disconnect;

@end
</pre>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
// ... unmodified code omitted for brevity

-(void)connect  
{
    _connection = [_device connect:nil delegate:nil];  
    [_connection retain];  
}


-(void)disconnect
{
    [_connection disconnect];
    [_connection release];
    _connection = nil;
}
</pre>

<p>And add code in the <code>HelloMonkeyViewController</code> to call this new method
when the hangup button is pressed:</p>

<p><strong>HelloMonkeyViewController.m</strong></p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
// ...

-(IBAction)dialButtonPressed:(id)sender
{
    HelloMonkeyAppDelegate* appDelegate = (HelloMonkeyAppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;  
    MonkeyPhone* phone = appDelegate.phone;  
    [phone connect];  
}

-(IBAction)hangupButtonPressed:(id)sender  
{
    HelloMonkeyAppDelegate* appDelegate = (HelloMonkeyAppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
    MonkeyPhone* phone = appDelegate.phone;
    [phone disconnect];
}

@end
</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s everything!  Go ahead and make another call.  You can now press
the hangup button at any time and your connection will close.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-twilio-application">Set up your Twilio Application</h2>

<p>Wondering what actually happens when you connect using your app, and why
you keep hearing that same welcome message? The key to this mystery is
in this line in your PHP file:</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$token-&gt;allowClientOutgoing('APabe7650f654fc34655fc81ae71caa3ff');
</pre>

<p>This creates a security token that tells your device which Twilio
Application it will connect to. Applications are just references to
TwiML URLs that are fetched when a connection is established from a
device, a browser, or a phone. If you are not familiar with TwiML, we
suggest you head over to the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/twiml/">Twilio Markup Language Quick
Start</a>.</p>

<p>The string starting with &lsquo;AP&rsquo; is an Application SID. The default one
above is a demo app created by Twilio that serves up a very simple TwiML
document that uses <code>&lt;Say&gt;</code> to read a greeting.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s build a simple application in PHP to serve TwiML from your web
host. Create a new file called <code>hello-client-monkey-twiml.php</code> on your
server and paste the following code into that file:</p>

<p><strong>hello-client-monkey-twiml.php</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;?php header('Content-type: text/xml'); ?&gt;

&lt;Response&gt;
    &lt;Say&gt;Welcome to Twilio Client!&lt;/Say&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
</pre>

<p>Assuming your web server is at companyfoo.com, try loading up your new
PHP script: http:// companyfoo.com/hello-client-monkey-twiml.php in your
browser. All set?</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to create the new application in your <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/">Account
Dashboard</a>, so let&rsquo;s navigate to
the tab called &lsquo;Apps&rsquo;. This is where you can see all your current Twilio
Applications and create new ones. Select &lsquo;Add Application&rsquo; and complete
the form with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name - the name of your application. Choose whatever you want. </li>
  <li>Description - just something that describes your application a little
better. </li>
  <li>Voice Url - points to your web host serving some TwiML. In our case,
it should point to the PHP file we created above:
http://companyfoo.com/hello-client-monkey-twiml.php</li>
</ul>

<p>Click SAVE to create your app. Now, copy the newly created
ApplicationSid and paste it into the token generation code at the top of
the client script we created before:</p>

<pre class="brush: php">
$token-&gt;allowClientOutgoing('APXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'); // YOUR APPLICATION SID!
</pre>

<p>If you press the Dial button again, you should now be hearing your very
own welcome message!</p>

<p>Sweet. Now, what if you want to pass variables from your iOS app to the
script running on the server?</p>

<h2 id="passing-parameters-to-your-application">Passing Parameters to Your Application</h2>

<p>So you&rsquo;ve created a Twilio Application and connected to it from your iOS
device &ndash; frickin&rsquo; sweet!  Go get yourself a drink and celebrate!</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s make a Twilio Application that can actually do something
useful by passing data from your iOS app to your TwiML script. The most
useful thing we could think of was&hellip; dialing out to an arbitrary phone
number. It&rsquo;ll be easy, all we need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grab the phone number that you can enter in the text field.</li>
  <li>Pass that phone number along to <code>TCDevice</code>&rsquo;s
<code>-(void)connect:(NSDictionary*)parameters delegate:(id&lt;TCDeviceDelegate&gt;)delegate</code>
method. </li>
  <li>Update the <code>hello-client-monkey-twiml.php</code> to serve a TwiML that
contains the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/dial"><code>&lt;Dial&gt;</code></a> verb with the
phone number you passed in from your iOS device.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go do it!</p>

<p>The text field in the app is wired up to the property <code>numberField</code> in
<code>HelloMonkeyViewController</code>.  We&rsquo;ll now add some code to pass this through
to your script when creating the connection.</p>

<p>First, change the <code>MonkeyPhone</code>&rsquo;s <code>-(void)connect</code> method to take in an
<code>NSString*</code> for the phone number in MonkeyPhone.h:</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.h</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
@interface MonkeyPhone : NSObject
{
@private
    TCDevice* _device;  
    TCConnection* _connection;  
}

-(void)connect:(NSString*)phoneNumber;
-(void)disconnect;

@end
</pre>

<p>And add the number in to a <code>NSDictionary*</code> using the key <code>PhoneNumber</code> in
the method implementation.</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(void)connect:(NSString*)phoneNumber
{
    NSDictionary* parameters = nil;
    if ( [phoneNumber length] &gt; 0 )
    {
        parameters = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:phoneNumber forKey:@"PhoneNumber"];
    }
    _connection = [_device connect:parameters delegate:nil];
    [_connection retain];  
}
</pre>

<p>And finally, in <code>HelloMonkeyViewController.m</code>, pass the phone number from
the text field to the <code>-(void)connect:(NSString*)phoneNumber</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>HelloMonkeyViewController.m</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(IBAction)dialButtonPressed:(id)sender
{
    HelloMonkeyAppDelegate* appDelegate = (HelloMonkeyAppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
    MonkeyPhone* phone = appDelegate.phone;

    [phone connect:self.numberField.text];
}
</pre>

<p>Now, the <code>hello-client-monkey-twiml.php</code> will receive a <code>PhoneNumber</code>
parameter in the request when it&rsquo;s invoked from your app. Change the
hello-client-monkey-twiml.php to read the <code>PhoneNumber</code> parameter and
print that value into the
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/dial"><code>&lt;Dial&gt;</code></a> verb.</p>

<p><strong>hello-client-monkey-twiml.php</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: php">
&lt;?php
header('Content-type: text/xml');

// put a phone number you've verified with Twilio to use as a caller ID number:w
$callerId = "XXXXXXXXXX";
?&gt;
&lt;Response&gt;
    &lt;Dial callerId="&lt;?php echo $callerId ?&gt;"&gt;
        &lt;Number&gt;&lt;?php echo $_REQUEST["PhoneNumber"]; ?&gt;&lt;/Number&gt;
    &lt;/Dial&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
</pre>

<p>So, go ahead and compile your app for the iOS Simulator, run it, enter
your cell phone number in the box and hit dial.  Your phone will ring
and you can talk to yourself!  Huzzah!</p>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s about time apps started calling YOU. Keep reading.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-incoming-connections">Receiving Incoming Connections</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to initiate connections from your app, it&rsquo;s time
for your app to start receiving incoming connections!  By the end of
this tutorial, you will be able to call IN to your device using the iOS
Simulator (or vice-versa).  Hold on tight&hellip;</p>

<p>To receive incoming connections, we&rsquo;ll do the following things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Give the app client a name and &ldquo;register&rdquo; it with Twilio.   </li>
  <li>Add callbacks to notify your app of incoming connections via
delegate methods.</li>
  <li>Write some TwiML to <code>&lt;Dial&gt;</code> your named <code>&lt;Client&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, start by modifying your <code>auth.php</code> file to accept a client name
parameter (<code>clientName</code>):</p>

<p><strong>auth.php</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: php">
&lt;?php

include 'Services/Twilio/Capability.php';

$accountSid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";  // YOUR ACCOUNT SID!
$authToken = "secret";  // YOUR AUTH TOKEN!
$appSid = "APXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"; // YOUR APPLICATION SID!

$clientName = $_REQUEST["clientName"]; // The client name for incoming connections
$capability = new Services_Twilio_Capability($accountSid, $authToken);

// This allows incoming connections as $clientName
$capability-&gt;allowClientIncoming($clientName);

// This allows outgoing connections to $appSid with the
// "From" parameter being $clientName
$capability-&gt;allowClientOutgoing($appSid, array(), $clientName);

// This returns a token to use with Twilio based on
// the account and capabilities defined above
$token = $capability-&gt;generateToken();
echo $token;
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>And change <code>MonkeyPhone.m</code> to pass this client name to the PHP file when
it starts up.  (In a real app, you would pass a username/password
combination from <code>UITextField</code>s, but we&rsquo;ll omit this for simplicity.)</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong></p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(id)init  
{
    if ( self = [super init] )
    {
        NSURL* url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://companyfoo.com/auth.php?clientName=jenny"];

        // ... unchanged code omitted
    }
    return self;
}
</pre>

<p><code>TCDevice</code> announces the important events to an object that implements the
<code>TCDeviceDelegate</code> protocol:</p>

<p><code>-(void)deviceDidStartListeningForIncomingConnections:(TCDevice*)device</code>
* callback for when the device is successfully registered with Twilio.</p>

<p><code>-(void)device:(TCDevice*)device didStopListeningForIncomingConnections:(NSError*)error</code>
* callback for when the device is no longer listening for incoming
  connections due to error or a call to <code>-[TCDevice unlisten]</code>.</p>

<p><code>-(void)device:(TCDevice*)device didReceiveIncomingConnection:(TCConnection*)connection</code>
* callback for when a client receives an incoming connection</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll modify the <code>MonkeyPhone</code> class to implement these methods:</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.h</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
#import "TCDevice.h"
#import "TCConnection.h"
#import "TCDeviceDelegate.h"

@interface MonkeyPhone : NSObject&lt;TCDeviceDelegate&gt;
{
@private
        TCDevice* _device;  
        TCConnection* _connection;  
}

-(void)connect:(NSString*)phoneNumber;  
-(void)disconnect;  

-(void)deviceDidStartListeningForIncomingConnections:(TCDevice*)device;
-(void)device:(TCDevice*)device didStopListeningForIncomingConnections:(NSError*)error;
-(void)device:(TCDevice*)device didReceiveIncomingConnection:(TCConnection*)connection;

@end
</pre>

<p>Next register the instance of <code>MonkeyPhone</code> to be the <code>TCDevice</code>&rsquo;s delegate
during <code>-(id)init</code>:</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(id)init
{
    // ... unchanged code omitted

    if (httpResponse.statusCode == 200)  
    {  
        NSString* capabilityToken = [[[NSString alloc] initWithData:data
                                                           encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]
                                     autorelease];
        _device = [[TCDevice alloc] initWithCapabilityToken:capabilityToken
                                                   delegate:self];
    }  

    // ... unchanged code omitted

    return self;
}
</pre>

<p>Finally, implement
<code>-(void)device:(TCDevice*)device didReceiveIncomingConnection:(TCConnection*)connection</code>
and have it accept the incoming connection when we get the callback.
Note that we go ahead and disconnect any existing connection first.</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(void)device:(TCDevice*)device didReceiveIncomingConnection:(TCConnection*)connection
{
    if ( _connection )
    {
        [self disconnect];
    }
    _connection = [connection retain];
    [_connection accept];
}
</pre>

<p>For completeness, implement the remaining two delegate methods to print
out the various state transitions and any errors (note that
<code>-device:didIncomingListenerBecomeOffline:</code> is a <code>@required</code> method for the
delegate):</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong></p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(void)deviceDidStartListeningForIncomingConnections:(TCDevice*)device
{
    NSLog(@"Device is now listening for incoming connections");
}

-(void)device:(TCDevice*)device didStopListeningForIncomingConnections:(NSError*)error
{
    if ( !error )
    {
        NSLog(@"Device is no longer listening for incoming connections");
    }
    else
    {
        NSLog(@"Device no longer listening for incoming connections due to error: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>If you compile and run the app, it&rsquo;s now ready to receive incoming
calls!  Now we need to
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers">provision a Twilio phone number</a>
and configure the Voice URL to point to a simple TwiML file which we
will create and name: <code>call-jenny.xml</code>.</p>

<p><strong>call-jenny.xml</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;Response&gt;
    &lt;Dial&gt;
        &lt;Client&gt;jenny&lt;/Client&gt;
    &lt;/Dial&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you put this file at the root of your companyfoo.com web site, you
can change your Voice URL for your Twilio App to be
http://companyfoo.com/call-jenny.xml.</p>

<p>Call your Twilio number and you should be connected to your device (or
iOS Simulator, whichever you&rsquo;re running), which will automatically
answer the call! Start talkin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Ready to put it all together?</p>

<h2 id="making-calls-inout-of-your-app">Making Calls In/Out of Your App</h2>

<p>Time to put it all together&hellip; using your quick start skills, you&rsquo;ve
already initiated an outgoing connection, and received an incoming
connection. Now, let&rsquo;s call from one client to another!</p>

<p>For this example, we&rsquo;ll make a call between the iOS Simulator and your
device.</p>

<p>To do this, we&rsquo;ll need to log in as two different users.  We&rsquo;ll change
the log in code to register as &ldquo;tommy&rdquo; for the app in the iOS Simulator,
and &ldquo;jenny&rdquo; for the app on your iOS device.</p>

<p>In <code>MonkeyPhone.m</code>&rsquo;s <code>-(id)init</code> method, add some conditional-compilation
code:</p>

<p><strong>MonkeyPhone.m</strong>   </p>

<pre class="brush: oc">
-(id)init
{
    if ( self = [super init] )
    {  
#if TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR
        NSURL* url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://companyfoo.com/auth.php?clientName=tommy"];
#else
        NSURL* url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://companyfoo.com/auth.php?clientName=jenny"];
#endif

        // ... unchanged code omitted
    }
    return self;
}

Next we'll change the TwiML PHP file to connect your two clients
together.  So, change the file `hello-client-monkey-twiml.php` to:

**hello-client-monkey-twiml.php**

&lt;pre class="brush: php";
&lt;?php
header('Content-type: text/xml');

$number = $_REQUEST["PhoneNumber"];

// put a phone number you've verified with Twilio to use as a caller ID number
$callerId = "XXXXXXXXXX";
?&gt;
&lt;Response&gt;
    &lt;Dial callerId="&lt;?php echo $callerId ?&gt;"&gt;
    &lt;?php if (preg_match("/^\d+$/", $number)) { ?&gt;
        &lt;Number&gt;&lt;?php echo $number;?&gt;&lt;/Number&gt;
    &lt;?php } else { ?&gt;
        &lt;Client&gt;&lt;?php echo $number;?&gt;&lt;/Client&gt;
    &lt;?php } ?&gt;
    &lt;/Dial&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
</pre>

<p>What the above PHP program does is simply to check whether the
<code>PhoneNumber</code> is only digits and if so, write that out within the
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/number"><code>&lt;Number&gt;</code></a>-noun (which then
will call a regular phone) otherwise write out a
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/client"><code>&lt;Client&gt;</code></a>-noun instead,
which will try and connect to a named Twilio Client app (a browser or
another mobile client).</p>

<p>So now build, install, and run your app on both your iOS device and the
iOS Simulator.  Then have one of the platforms call the other (e.g. by
typing &ldquo;tommy&rdquo; into the iOS device&rsquo;s app).  Once the connection has been
established you should be able to talk between your phone and your
laptop!</p>

<p>You can also dial regular phone numbers from your iOS app as long as you
replace the <code>$callerId</code> value in the PHP above with a phone number that&rsquo;s
verified with your Twilio Account.  See the &ldquo;Verified Numbers&rdquo; section
under the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers">Numbers</a>
tab in your Twilio Account.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this quick start.  If you want to learn more about the iOS
library that we have been using throughout this document, then head over
to the iOS API Reference Xcode DocSet included with the SDK.</p>
